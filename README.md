# K-Mean-clustering

Business Case :
there is a mall in specific city which their clients subscribes for their cards, they can shop whatsoever at the mall with that card.
based on several criteria including for example their income the number of times per week they show
up in the mall,and of course the amount of dollars they spent in a year , Mall computed the score for each client which takes values between 1 and 100.
And eventually after collecting this data set the company,Mall marketing team wants to segment their clients in two different groups based on these two metrics:
1-The annual income
2- the spending score 
The mall has no idea of what this client segments might be or even has no idea about how many segments there would be.
This is typically a clustering problem because we don't know the answers.
So now let's start and use the K-means algorithm to find out what those clusters of clients might be.
we are interested in the annual income and the spending score to create a two dimensional clusters of data.
